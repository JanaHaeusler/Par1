## Description

### An app for ambitious minigolf players

Par1 offers ambitious minigolf players a place where they can save their games with all important information. Thereby, game details of past games as well as the development steps of the players can be retrieved at any time.

## Main Feature

Users can fill out a form that asks for all important game details such as location and date as well as who has played and won. Additionally, it keeps track of the scores of all players at all 18 holes. These Information are saved and can be retrieved at any time. Furthermore, game entries can be edited and deleted as well.

## Motivation

In the summer, my friends and I are often playing minigolf together - occasionally resulting in a little seasonal competition. But at the end it is very likely that we have lost track of all our games and scores. You could imagine how we discuss with a wink who had won.
With my app, Par1, I would like to provide a space to save all these important game details and scores. Allowing us to have less discussions and more of a nice after game get-together.
